        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1¼ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1¼ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, cream the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together until mixture is light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the egg, milk, and vanilla extract. Whisk liquids together in small areas around the bowl, then all together to avoid separation.</li>
        <li>Pour dry ingredients into the wet ingredients; stir until flour is thoroughly mixed in. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Scoop out rounded tablespoons of dough and place on prepared baking sheet, leaving 4 inches of space between cookies (about 8 per sheet). Bake in preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, about 12 minutes. Slide parchment and cookies onto a cooling rack for a few minutes. Remove parchment and finish cooling the cookies on the rack.</li>
    </ol>
